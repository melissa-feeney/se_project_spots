**Intro**

This project is the first stage in creating an interactive social media web application where users will eventually be able to add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their profile. The website is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. I started by buiding the website for a screen size of 1440px. Once I completed that, I used media queries to allow for a responsive design with a minimum screen width of 320px. Once the width is between 627px and 320px, it changes to a mobile version.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
